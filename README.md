# hate-speech-detection

This Hate Speech Detection App is a project that leverages a Decision Tree Classifier to identify hate speech in text. Built using Python, Streamlit, and NLTK. The app preprocesses text data with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, applies a bag-of-words representation using CountVectorizer, and trains a Decision Tree Classifier. Users can input text for hate speech detection through a Streamlit interface, which also supports real-time speech input.

# Features:
1. Hate speech detection using a Decision Tree Classifier
